\arguments{
\item{sp.code}{(character) 4-letter species code}

\item{file.name}{(character vector) data file names to read in}

\item{file.label}{(character vector) labels for data files}

\item{file.path}{(character) path where data files are located}

\item{keep.subsp}{(logical) whether to keep records of subsp (T) or not (F)}

\item{keep.cols}{(character list) column names to keep for each data file}

\item{region}{(sf list) region (output from make_region())}

\item{filter.region}{(logical) Only keep data within region (T) or not (F)}

\item{year.start}{(numeric) keep data during or after this year}

\item{year.end}{(numeric) keep data during or before this year; defaults to current year}

\item{coordunc}{(numeric) if data has coord.unc column (e.g., GBIF data), remove records with coord.unc > coordunc}

\item{coordunc_na.rm}{(logical) if data has coord.unc column (e.g., GBIF data), remove records with coord.unc == NA (T) or not (F)}

\item{spat.thin}{(logical) if data is PO, do spatial thinning at 2km x 2km grid cell (T) or not (F)}

\item{keep.conus.grid.id}{(character vector) Which grid cells to keep (e.g., for cross validation); defaults to all grid cells in the region}
}
\value{
A list with two objects. The first object (locs) is a dataframe containing the coordinate locations of all observations. The second object (obs) is a list containing a dataframe for each dataset and the conus.grid.id location of each observation.
