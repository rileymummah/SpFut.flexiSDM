\usage{
count_filter(
  data,
  covs.mean,
  covs.sum,
  offset.area,
  age.use = c("adult", "metamorph", "juvenile", "larva", "egg mass", "NR", NA),

    "survey.id", "data.type", "species", "time.to.detect", "count")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(data.frame) dataframe from species.data$obs containing observations from one dataset}

\item{covs.mean}{(character vector) vector of column names to use as detection covariates that should be averaged across passes (e.g., water temperature)}

\item{covs.sum}{(character vector) vector of column names to use as detection covariates that should be summed across passes (e.g., survey duration)}

\item{offset.area}{(character) name of column to use for area offset}

\item{age.use}{(character vector) vector of age categories to use; defaults to c("adult", "metamorph", "juvenile", "larva", "egg mass", "NR", NA)}

\item{req.cols}{(character vector) which columns are required in the output dataframe; defaults to c("site.id", "lat", "lon", "day", "month", "year", "survey.conducted", "survey.id", "data.type", "species", "time.to.detect", "count")}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing clean and summarized observation data from one dataset.
}
\description{
Sets up count data for iSDM -- summarizes covariates. This function is wrapped within sppdata_for_nimble().
